  Abstract                 = {It is known that there exists a reduction from the CCA1-security of Damg{\aa}rd's Elgamal (DEG) cryptosystem to what we call the {\$}{\backslash}textrm{\{}ddh{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}textrm{\{}dsdh{\}}{\}}{\$} assumption. We show that {\$}{\backslash}textrm{\{}ddh{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}textrm{\{}dsdh{\}}{\}}{\$} is unnecessary for DEG-CCA1, while DDH is insufficient for DEG-CCA1. We also show that CCA1-security of the Elgamal cryptosystem is equivalent to another assumption {\$}{\backslash}textrm{\{}ddh{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}textrm{\{}csdh{\}}{\}}{\$} , while we show that {\$}{\backslash}textrm{\{}ddh{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}textrm{\{}dsdh{\}}{\}}{\$} is insufficient for Elgamal's CCA1-security. Finally, we prove a generic-group model lower bound {\$}{\backslash}Omega ({\backslash}sqrt[3]{\{}q{\}}){\$} for the hardest considered assumption {\$}{\backslash}textrm{\{}ddh{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}textrm{\{}csdh{\}}{\}}{\$} , where q is the largest prime factor of the group order.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates a novel computational problem, namely the Composite Residuosity Class Problem, and its applications to public-key cryptography. We propose a new trapdoor mechanism and derive from this technique three encryption schemes: a trapdoor permutation and two homomorphic probabilistic encryption schemes computationally comparable to RSA. Our cryptosystems, based on usual modular arithmetics, are provably secure under appropriate assumptions in the standard model.},
