  Abstract                 = {Several secure distributed data mining methods have been proposed in the literature that are based on privacy preserving set operation mechanisms. However, they are limited in the scalability of both the size and the number of data owners (sources). Most of these techniques are primarily designed to work with two data owners and extensions to handle multiple owners are either expensive or infeasible. In addition, for large datasets, they incur substantial communication/computation overhead due to the use of cryptographic techniques. In this paper, we propose a scalable privacy-preserving protocol that approximates global itemset support, without employing any cryptographic mechanism. We also present some emperical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Private set operation (PSO) protocols provide a natural way of securely performing operations on data sets, such that crucial details of the input sets are not revealed. Such protocols have an ever-increasing number of practical applications, particularly when implementing privacy-preserving data mining schemes. Protocols for computing private set operations have been prevalent in multi-party computation literature over the past decade, and in the case of private set intersection (PSI), have become practically feasible to run in real applications. In contrast, other set operations such as union have received less attention from the research community, and the few existing designs are often limited in their feasibility. In this work we aim to fill this gap, and present a new technique using Bloom filter data structures and additive homomorphic encryption to develop the first private set union protocol with both linear computation and communication complexities. Moreover, we show how to adapt this protocol to give novel ways of computing PSI and private set intersection/union cardinality with only minor changes to the protocol computation. Our work resembles therefore a toolkit for scalable private set computation with linear complexities, and we provide a thorough experimental analysis that shows that the online phase of our designs is practical up to large set sizes.},

We further extend these to PSI and APSI protocols. All the constructions are proven to be secure in standard model with linear complexities. Moreover, our protocols hide the size of the client's private set which may be sensitive in application specific scenarios. The proposed PSI-CA and APSI-CA are the first to achieve security in standard model under the Quadratic Residuosity (QR) assumption with linear complexities.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we propose a new approach to privately compute the set-union cardinality and the set-intersection cardinality among multiple honest-but-curious parties. Our approach is inspired by a proposal of Ashok and Mukkamala (DBSec'14) which deploys Bloom filters to approximate the size tightly. One advantage of their solution is that it avoids ample public-key cryptography. Unfortunately, we show here that their protocol is vulnerable to actual attacks. We therefore propose a new Bloom filter based protocol, also forgoing heavy cryptography, and prove its security.},
